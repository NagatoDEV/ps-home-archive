# PlayStation Home Archive

This is the README and associated CSV files I handed over to the Internet
Archive, that catalogues the data I harvested from PlayStation Home before it
was closed. Mirroring it here on GitHub for usefulness sake. Once the archive
is live, I shall update and link to it from here.

----------

A snapshot of data from PlayStation Home at 2015-04-01, the day it was closed.
I hope this collection is useful to maintain our gaming heritage, and that
possibly some day, some will be able to walk around as a vending machine in a
future FOSS Home client.
Cannot gauge the accuracy or completeness of this collection without hard
numbers from people that would know better, but I would suggest for everything
that Home was, we have ~90% of Objects and 60% of Scenes. I want to thank
Cubehouse (Jamie Holding) of alphazone4.com whom I got in touch with on 29th
March — just a few days ago! — with my worries that I would not be able to archive
as much of Home as exists, and he provided a wealth of data (missing IDs!) that
without, this snapshot would have been around 15GiB instead.
Contribution of missing data is _very_ welcome and sought after, get in touch.
